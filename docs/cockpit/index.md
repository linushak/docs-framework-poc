## Cockpit hierarchy

Cockpit is based on a hierarchy of the following entity types:

entities defined in Cockpit are equivalent to the same entities in APIM

Each entity managed in Cockpit has some common properties:

-   ID: an internal ID that is never shown in the Cockpit UI, but that
    you can find if you look at the API responses.

-   HRID: a human readable ID of the entity. This ID is unique (no two
    environments in the same organization can have the same HRID), and
    they are used to provide readable URLs.

-   Name: the name of the entity.

-   Description: a description of the entity.

## Example hierarchy

The Cockpit hierarchy pictured below has the following setup:

-   One APIM installation, with two Gateway nodes and one REST API node.

-   One AM installation, with one Gateway node and one REST API node.
