    PORTAL** button:

    Directly in your browser, with the `http://PORTAL_UI_SERVER_DOMAIN`
    URL created during installation.

During the APIM installation process a default administrator account is
created. By default, the login details for the APIM Portal administrator
account are `admin / admin`. Ordinary users of APIM Portal need to
obtain their user credentials from an administrator.

To log in:

1.  Open APIM Portal and click **Sign in**.
