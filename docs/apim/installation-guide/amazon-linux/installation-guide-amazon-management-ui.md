# Install Management UI

## Prerequisites

- Machine up and running
- Gravitee YUM repository added
- Gravitee APIM REST API installed and running
- Nginx installed

## Security group

- open port 8084

## Instructions

1. Install Management UI:
  ```
  sudo yum install graviteeio-apim-management-ui-3x -y
  ```
2. Restart Nginx:
  ```
  sudo systemctl restart nginx
  ```
3. Verify:
  ```
  sudo ss -lntp '( sport = 8084 )'
  ```
    You should see that thereâ€™s a process listening on that port.

!!! note

    The Management UI package does not provide its own service. It provides:

    - A javascript application that can be found at `/opt/graviteeio/apim/management-ui`.
    - An Nginx configuration that can be found at `/etc/nginx/conf.d/graviteeio-apim-management-ui.conf`.

## Next steps

The next step is [installing the Gravitee APIM Portal UI](installation-guide-amazon-portal-ui.md).
