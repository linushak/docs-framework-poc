# APIM Installation Guide - Component - Install all

## Prerequisites

- Machine up and running
- Gravitee YUM repository added
- Java 11 jre installed
- MongoDB installed and running
- Elasticsearch installed and running
- Nginx installed

## Security group

- open port 8082
- open port 8083
- open port 8084
- open port 8085

## Instructions

1. Install all Gravitee APIM components:
  ```
  sudo yum install graviteeio-apim-3x -y
  ```
2. Enable Gateway and REST API on startup:
  ```
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl enable graviteeio-apim-gateway
  sudo systemctl enable graviteeio-apim-rest-api
  ```
3. Start Gateway and REST API:
  ```
  sudo systemctl start graviteeio-apim-gateway
  sudo systemctl start graviteeio-apim-rest-api
  ```
4. Restart Nginx:
  ```
  sudo systemctl restart nginx
  ```
5. Fix an issue.
  There is a known issue with the Portal UI configuration. You can find a fix [here](installation-guide-amazon-issue.md).
6.  Verify:
  ```
  sudo journalctl -f
  ```
  Follow along with the startup process. If any of the prerequisites is missing, this is were youâ€™ll get error messages.
  You can also see the same in `/opt/graviteeio/apim/gateway/logs/gravitee.log` and `/opt/graviteeio/apim/rest-api/logs/gravitee.log`.
7.  Verify some more:
  ```
  sudo ss -lntp '( sport = 8082 )'
  sudo ss -lntp '( sport = 8083 )'
  sudo ss -lntp '( sport = 8084 )'
  sudo ss -lntp '( sport = 8085 )'
  ```
  You should see that there are processes listening on those ports.
8.  Verify some more still:
  ```
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8082/
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8083/management/organizations/DEFAULT/console
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8083/portal/environments/DEFAULT/apis
  ```
  If the installation is successful the first one returns: **No context-path matches the request URI.** The others return a JSON structure.

**Congratulations**, you have a fully functional Gravitee APIM!
