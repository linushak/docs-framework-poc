# Install Portal UI

## Prerequisites

- Machine up and running
- Gravitee YUM repository added
- Gravitee APIM REST API installed and running
- Nginx installed

## Security group

- open port 8085

## Instructions

1. Install Portal UI:
  ```
  sudo yum install graviteeio-apim-portal-ui-3x -y
  ```
2. Restart Nginx:
  ```
  sudo systemctl restart nginx
  ```
3. Fix an issue. There is a known issue with the Portal UI configuration. You can find a fix [here](installation-guide-amazon-issue.md).
4. Verify:
  ```
  sudo ss -lntp '( sport = 8085 )'
  ```
    You should see that thereâ€™s a process listening on that port.

!!! note

    The Portal UI package does not provide its own service. It provides:
    - A javascript application that can be found at `/opt/graviteeio/apim/portal-ui`.
    - An Nginx configuration that can be found at `/etc/nginx/conf.d/graviteeio-apim-portal-ui.conf`.

**Congratulations**, you have a fully functional Gravitee APIM!
