# Full stack installation

## Prerequisites

- Machine up and running

## Security group

- open port 8082
- open port 8083
- open port 8084
- open port 8085

## Instructions

1. Install all the prerequisites and Gravitee APIM components:
  ```
  curl -L https://bit.ly/install-apim-3x | sudo bash
  ```
2. Fix a known post-installation issue. There is a known issue with the Portal UI configuration. You can
    find a fix [here](installation-guide-amazon-issue.md).
3.  Verify:
  ```
  sudo ss -lntp '( sport = 9200 )'
  sudo ss -lntp '( sport = 27017 )'
  sudo ss -lntp '( sport = 8082 )'
  sudo ss -lntp '( sport = 8083 )'
  sudo ss -lntp '( sport = 8084 )'
  sudo ss -lntp '( sport = 8085 )'
  ```
    You should see that there are processes listening on those ports.
4.  Verify some more:
  ```
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8082/
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8083/management/organizations/DEFAULT/console
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8083/portal/environments/DEFAULT/apis
  ```
    If the installation is successful the first one returns: **No context-path matches the request URI.** The others return a json structure.

**Congratulations**, you have a fully functional Gravitee APIM!
