# Differences between Design function and new Design Studio

With the **Design** function, HTTP methods were linked directly to
policies. With Design Studio, HTTP methods are linked to a flow. This
means that you could have a path with policies linked to different HTTP
Methods. The migration transforms each "Path"-"HTTP methods"-"Policy"
into one flow.

By default, the selection of a flow is based on the operator defined in
the flow itself.

You can use the operator either to select a flow with a path which
matches exactly, or when the start of the path matches. You can then use
the **Best match** option to select the flow from the path that is
closest.
