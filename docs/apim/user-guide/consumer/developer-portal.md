# Overview

This section explains how to consume APIs using APIM Portal.

# Access

You can access APIM Portal without a connection (as an anonymous user),
but to do anything with an API, you need to connect with a user account
and subscribe to some *plans*.

The default view in APIM Portal shows all the APIs the authenticated
user can access (or only *public* APIs for anonymous users).

The rules for accessing APIs is as follows:

-   Public API: all users

-   Private API: a user must be a member of the API (user, owner,
    primary\_owner)
