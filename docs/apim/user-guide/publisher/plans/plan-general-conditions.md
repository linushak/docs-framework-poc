# Overview

You can provide general conditions of use for a plan. These conditions
must be accepted by the user to finalize the subscription process.

To associate general conditions of use with a plan, you need to specify
a markdown page where these conditions are specified.

Plans with general conditions are identified by a
`With general conditions` label.

Users can only subscribe to plans with general conditions through APIM
Portal.
