# Overview

When you first create your API, by default it is defined as a private
API and cannot be accessed through APIM Portal or subscribed to.

If you want to grant specific users or groups access to a private API,
the way to do this is by managing its members.

Only users with the required permissions can manage an applicationâ€™s
members. For more details, see link:{{
*/apim/3.x/apim\_adminguide\_roles\_and\_permissions.html* |
relative\_url }}\[Roles and permissions\].

# Roles

By default, APIM includes three membership roles:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: center;">Role</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><p><strong>Primary Owner</strong></p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>When an API is created, the Primary
Owner is the creator of the API. A Primary Owner can perform all
possible actions on an API.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;"><p><strong>Owner</strong></p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>Owner is similar to the Primary Owner
role. An Owner can perform all the same actions on an API apart from
change the context-path of the API or delete it.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><p><strong>User</strong></p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>A User is a person who can access the
API and subscribe to it through a plan.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

# Transfer ownership

You can transfer ownership of an API or application from one user to
another. You do this when the current Primary Owner leaves a project,
for example.

From APIM 3.7, you can also transfer ownership to a group, depending on
your configuration. For more details, see link:{{
*/apim/3.x/apim\_adminguide\_users\_and\_groups.html#primary\_owner\_mode*
| relative\_url }}\[Configure primary owners as groups^\].

1.  In APIM Console, click **APIs** or **Applications** in the left
    menu.

2.  If you want to transfer ownership for an:

    -   application, click **Applications** in the menu, then select
        your application and click **Members**.

    -   API, click **APIs** in the menu, then select your API and click
        **Portal &gt; Transfer ownership**.

3.  Choose the new Primary Owner or Primary Owner Group.

    You can only select a Primary Owner Group which you belong to. If
    your Primary owner mode is configured as **GROUP**, you can only
    select a Primary Owner Group and not a user.

4.  Choose the new role of the current Primary Owner, if the current
    Primary Owner is a user.

5.  Click **TRANSFER**.
